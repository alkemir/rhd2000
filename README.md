# rhd2000
Python bindings for the rhd2000 evaluation board

This repository provides bindings to the C++ Rhythm API through ctypes (and hand-written C wrapper code).
Also, the GUI has been reimplemented in Python (PyQt5) following the original code closely, so that updating
the code or extending the GUI are simple tasks.

Any help is welcome, and I will try to maintain the code up to date with Intan software. If you find a bug,
please let me know!
